Naloxone reverses the antihypertensive effect of clonidine.
In unanesthetized, spontaneously hypertensive rats the decrease in blood pressure and heart rate produced by intravenous clonidine, 5 to 20 micrograms/kg, was inhibited or reversed by nalozone.
The hypotensive effect of 100 mg/kg alpha-methyldopa was also partially reversed by naloxone.
Naloxone alone did not affect either blood pressure or heart rate.
In brain membranes from spontaneously hypertensive rats clonidine, 10(-8) to 10(-5) M, did not influence stereoselective binding of [3H]-naloxone (8 nM), and naloxone, 10(-8) to 10(-4) M, did not influence clonidine-suppressible binding of [3H]-dihydroergocryptine (1 nM).
